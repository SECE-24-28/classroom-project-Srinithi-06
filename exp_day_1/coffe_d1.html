        <P>A coffee shop is an establishment that serves coffee and other beverages, along with light snacks like
            pastries, sandwiches, and cakes. These places are known for their casual, cozy, and inviting atmosphere,
            providing a space for customers to socialize, work, or relax. They typically offer a variety of drinks,
            including espresso-based options and specialty coffees, as well as other beverages like tea and hot
            chocolate</P>
